# The-Robot-s-Car-with-a-Box
Here is a robot's car with a box that carries the components needed to help the car and the arm working.
Also there's a Morphological analysis used to give more ideas for the design of a car
I chose the car to be:
1- four wheels
2- Servo motor used
3- Wooden base
4- circle base shape 
5- circle wheels
